Question 1: Write a function flattenArray(arr) that takes an array arr containing nested arrays and uses the reduce method to flatten it into a single-level array.
Example  : console.log(flattenArray([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


Question 2: Write a function sumPositiveNumbers(arr) that takes an array arr of numbers and uses the reduce method to calculate the sum of all positive numbers in the array.

Example usage:
console.log(sumPositiveNumbers([-1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6])); // Output: 12
Question 3: Write a function groupByLength(words) that takes an array words containing strings and uses the reduce method to group the words by their lengths. The function should return an object where the keys are the lengths of the words and the values are arrays containing the words of that length.

Example usage:
console.log(groupByLength(['apple', 'banana', 'pear', 'kiwi', 'grape'])); 
// Output: { 3: ['pear'], 5: ['apple', 'kiwi', 'grape'], 6: ['banana'] }
Question 4: Write a function calculateAverage(arr) that takes an array arr of numbers and uses the reduce method to calculate the average of all numbers in the array.

Example usage:
console.log(calculateAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 3
